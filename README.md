# Analysis of COVID-19 outbreak 

Working from home and with a desire to practice my data science skills, I have decided to embark on this project to be both useful and resourceful. I will analyze the COVID-19 outbreak using R + Python. 

## Stage One 
* Comparing ETL methods in R + Python 

## Stage Two 
* Visualizing data using R, Python, + Tableau 

### Stage Three 
* Longitudinal analysis
